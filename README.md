# Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## Overview:
### [Deployed Application](https://jq-hoang.github.io/css_portfolio/)
### [Github Repo](https://github.com/jq-hoang/css_portfolio)


## My Task:
I am tasked with creating a CSS Portfolio Mockup to present to potential future employers.

**Note:** Placeholder images and names are acceptable for this assignment.
The idea is to change them to real applications as you create them later in the course to showcase. 

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```


## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
